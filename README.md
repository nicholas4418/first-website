# First Website

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to refactor an already existing website so that it meets accessibility standards.
- I worked on this project as a means to familiarize myself better with some of the core fundamentals of web development, as well as practicing using git bash.
- The problem this project solves is that the provided code was not properly optimized for search engines due to its lack of accessibility. The code itself was also not structured in a logical way.
- I learned about the importance of semantic HTML elements and logical code formating. I also learned about a few other HTML attributes, such as the "alt" attribute. And I learned that commenting can be a useful tool, for myself and other people that may work on my code.
